## Development
You need to have angular-cli installed to run development server and make builds: `https://cli.angular.io/`

Frontend commands are run from client folder: `cd client`  

Install all dependencies: `npm i`  

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `nmp run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `../docs` directory (convenient for hosting on github pages).
